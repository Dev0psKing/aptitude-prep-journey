## 🧠 What is Aptitude?

**Aptitude** refers to a person’s **natural ability to perform tasks or solve problems**.  
It’s your *instinctive strength* in approaching challenges, calculations, and logical situations.

For example:  
> When you’re presented with a question, your natural tendency to attempt it shows your **aptitude**,  
> while the way you analyze and solve it reflects your **reasoning**.

Together, they form the foundation of your analytical and problem-solving mindset.

## 🧩 Core Categories of Aptitude

### 1️⃣ Quantitative Aptitude
**Quantitative aptitude** tests your ability to use **numbers, logic, and data** to solve real-world problems.

- **What it tests:** Numerical accuracy, calculation speed, and data interpretation  
- **Why it matters:** ~60% of aptitude exams (like IBPS, SBI PO, CAT, SAT, GMAT etc) rely heavily on this section  
- **Pro Tip:** Learn *elimination and approximation tricks* for faster results  

> 💡 **Quick Challenge:**  
> If a price increases by 25% and then decreases by 25%, is the final price the same?  
> **Hint:** Try $100 - you’ll end up with $93.75, not $100!

---

### 2️⃣ Logical Reasoning
**Logical reasoning** is your ability to **analyze information, identify patterns, and draw valid conclusions**.

- **What it tests:** Pattern recognition, deduction, and analytical decision-making  
- **Why it matters:** Used extensively in **TCS, Infosys**, and CAT’s **DILR** section  
- **Pro Tip:** Most puzzles reuse the *same 5–7 logic structures* — learn to spot them!  

> 💡 **Quick Challenge:**  
> If all X are Y, and some Y are Z, does that mean some X are Z?  
> ❌ **No!** — and 60% of people get this wrong.

---

### 3️⃣ Verbal Ability
**Verbal ability** assesses your **command of language**, comprehension, and expression.

- **What it tests:** Grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, and verbal logic  
- **Why it matters:** Highly weighted in **CAT, GRE, and GMAT** — slow readers lose marks  
- **Pro Tip:** Focus on *context*, not just memorizing definitions  

> 💡 **Quick Challenge:**  
> Is this sentence correct?  
> “The team are arguing over their strategy.”  
> ✅ **Yes!** Collective nouns can take plural verbs when emphasizing individuals.
