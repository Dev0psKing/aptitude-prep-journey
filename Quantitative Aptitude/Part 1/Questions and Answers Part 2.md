## 🧮 Example 1: Simplify

**(i)** 8888 + 888 + 88 + 8  
**(ii)** 715632 - 631104 - 9874 - 999  

**Explanation Breakdown:**

These are straightforward addition and subtraction problems. For (i), it's just careful column addition. For (ii), remember that subtracting multiple numbers is the same as subtracting their sum.

**(i) 8888 + 888 + 88 + 8**

1.  **Align by Place Value:** When adding multiple numbers, it's easiest to stack them vertically, making sure the ones digits, tens digits, hundreds digits, etc., line up.

    ```
      8888
       888
        88
     +   8
     -----
    ```

2.  **Add the Ones Column:**
    *   `8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 32`
    *   Write down `2` in the ones place of the answer and carry over `3` to the tens column.

    ```
        ³
      8888
       888
        88
     +   8
     -----
         2
    ```

3.  **Add the Tens Column (including carry-over):**
    *   `3 (carry) + 8 + 8 + 8 = 27`
    *   Write down `7` in the tens place of the answer and carry over `2` to the hundreds column.

    ```
       ²³
      8888
       888
        88
     +   8
     -----
        72
    ```

4.  **Add the Hundreds Column (including carry-over):**
    *   `2 (carry) + 8 + 8 = 18`
    *   Write down `8` in the hundreds place of the answer and carry over `1` to the thousands column.

    ```
      ¹²³
      8888
       888
        88
     +   8
     -----
       872
    ```

5.  **Add the Thousands Column (including carry-over):**
    *   `1 (carry) + 8 = 9`
    *   Write down `9` in the thousands place of the answer.

    ```
      ¹²³
      8888
       888
        88
     +   8
     -----
      9872
    ```

**(ii) 715632 - 631104 - 9874 - 999**

1.  **Group the Subtractions:** When you have a number minus several other numbers, it's like taking away multiple amounts. You can add up all the amounts you're taking away first, and then subtract that total from the original number.
    *   `715632 - (631104 + 9874 + 999)`

2.  **Add the numbers being subtracted:**
    *   `631104 + 9874 + 999`
    *   Let's add these vertically:
        ```
          631104
            9874
          +  999
          -------
        ```
        *   Ones: `4 + 4 + 9 = 17` (write `7`, carry `1`)
        *   Tens: `1 (carry) + 0 + 7 + 9 = 17` (write `7`, carry `1`)
        *   Hundreds: `1 (carry) + 1 + 8 + 9 = 19` (write `9`, carry `1`)
        *   Thousands: `1 (carry) + 1 + 9 = 11` (write `1`, carry `1`)
        *   Ten Thousands: `1 (carry) + 3 = 4` (write `4`)
        *   Hundred Thousands: `6` (write `6`)
        *   So, `631104 + 9874 + 999 = 641977`.

3.  **Perform the final subtraction:**
    *   `715632 - 641977`
    *   Let's subtract vertically:
        ```
          715632
        - 641977
        --------
        ```
        *   Ones: `2 - 7` (can't do). Borrow from 3, so `12 - 7 = 5`. (3 becomes 2).
        *   Tens: `2 - 7` (can't do). Borrow from 6, so `12 - 7 = 5`. (6 becomes 5).
        *   Hundreds: `5 - 9` (can't do). Borrow from 5, so `15 - 9 = 6`. (5 becomes 4).
        *   Thousands: `4 - 1 = 3`.
        *   Ten Thousands: `1 - 4` (can't do). Borrow from 7, so `11 - 4 = 7`. (7 becomes 6).
        *   Hundred Thousands: `6 - 6 = 0`.
        *   So, `715632 - 641977 = 73655`.

**✅ Solution:**

- **(i)**
  ```
    8888
     888
      88
   +   8
   -----
    9872
  ```
  `8888 + 888 + 88 + 8 = 9872`

- **(ii)**
  `715632 - 631104 - 9874 - 999`
  - First, add all the numbers being subtracted:
    `631104 + 9874 + 999 = 641977`
  - Now, perform the final subtraction:
    `715632 - 641977 = 73655`

### **🧮 Example 2: Find the value of (?)**

**(i)** ? - 1936248 = 1635773  
**(ii)** 9587 - ? = 7429 – 4358  

**Explanation Breakdown:**

These are simple algebra problems where we need to isolate the unknown variable, represented by `?`. Remember the rule: "Whatever you do to one side of an equation, you must do to the other side."

**(i) ? - 1936248 = 1635773**

1.  **Isolate '?'**: Currently, 1936248 is being subtracted from `?`. To get `?` by itself, we need to do the opposite operation: add 1936248 to both sides of the equation.
    *   `? - 1936248 + 1936248 = 1635773 + 1936248`
    *   `? = 1635773 + 1936248`

2.  **Perform the Addition:**
    *   `1635773 + 1936248`
    *   Add vertically:
        ```
          1635773
        + 1936248
        ---------
        ```
        *   Ones: `3 + 8 = 11` (write `1`, carry `1`)
        *   Tens: `1 (carry) + 7 + 4 = 12` (write `2`, carry `1`)
        *   Hundreds: `1 (carry) + 7 + 2 = 10` (write `0`, carry `1`)
        *   Thousands: `1 (carry) + 5 + 6 = 12` (write `2`, carry `1`)
        *   Ten Thousands: `1 (carry) + 3 + 3 = 7` (write `7`)
        *   Hundred Thousands: `6 + 9 = 15` (write `5`, carry `1`)
        *   Millions: `1 (carry) + 1 + 1 = 3` (write `3`)
        *   So, `1635773 + 1936248 = 3572021`.

**(ii) 9587 - ? = 7429 – 4358**

1.  **Simplify the Right Side First:** Before dealing with `?`, let's calculate the value of `7429 - 4358`.
    *   `7429 - 4358`
    *   Subtract vertically:
        ```
          7429
        - 4358
        ------
        ```
        *   Ones: `9 - 8 = 1`.
        *   Tens: `2 - 5` (can't do). Borrow from 4, so `12 - 5 = 7`. (4 becomes 3).
        *   Hundreds: `3 - 3 = 0`.
        *   Thousands: `7 - 4 = 3`.
        *   So, `7429 - 4358 = 3071`.

2.  **Rewrite the Equation:**
    *   Now the equation becomes: `9587 - ? = 3071`

3.  **Isolate '?'**: This time, `?` is being subtracted from `9587`.
    *   One way to think about it: If `9587` minus some number equals `3071`, then that `some number` must be `9587 - 3071`.
    *   Another way (algebraically):
        *   Add `?` to both sides: `9587 - ? + ? = 3071 + ?`
        *   `9587 = 3071 + ?`
        *   Subtract `3071` from both sides: `9587 - 3071 = ?`

4.  **Perform the Subtraction:**
    *   `9587 - 3071`
    *   Subtract vertically:
        ```
          9587
        - 3071
        ------
        ```
        *   Ones: `7 - 1 = 6`.
        *   Tens: `8 - 7 = 1`.
        *   Hundreds: `5 - 0 = 5`.
        *   Thousands: `9 - 3 = 6`.
        *   So, `9587 - 3071 = 6516`.

**✅ Solution:**

- **(i)** `? - 1936248 = 1635773`
  - To find `?`, add `1936248` to both sides:
  - `? = 1635773 + 1936248`
  - `? = 3572021`

- **(ii)** `9587 - ? = 7429 – 4358`
  - First, simplify the right side:
    `7429 - 4358 = 3071`
  - Now the equation is:
    `9587 - ? = 3071`
  - To find `?`, subtract `3071` from `9587`:
  - `? = 9587 - 3071`
  - `? = 6516`

✅ **Answer:** (i) **3572021**; (ii) **6516**

### **🧮 Example 3: Find the maximum value of Q**

Given:  
5P9 + 3R7 + 2Q8 = 1114  

**Explanation Breakdown:**

This is an addition puzzle involving missing digits (P, R, Q). We want to find the largest possible value for 'Q'. We'll solve this column by column, remembering to carry over digits as needed.

Let's represent the problem like this, showing the individual columns:

```
  Hundreds  Tens  Ones
    5        P     9
    3        R     7
  + 2        Q     8
  --------------------
    1        1     1     4  (This means 1 (thousand) 1 (hundred) 1 (ten) 4 (one))
```

1.  **Analyze the Ones Column (rightmost):**
    *   We add the digits in the ones place: `9 + 7 + 8`.
    *   `9 + 7 + 8 = 24`.
    *   The result in the answer's ones column is `4`. This matches the `4` in `24`.
    *   This means we write down `4` and **carry over `2`** to the tens column.

2.  **Analyze the Tens Column (middle):**
    *   We add the digits in the tens place: `P + R + Q`, PLUS the `2` we carried over from the ones column.
    *   The result in the answer's tens column is `1` (from `114`, meaning `1` ten).
    *   This implies that `2 (carry) + P + R + Q` must result in a number that ends in `1`. The smallest such number is `11`.
    *   So, `2 + P + R + Q = 11`.
    *   Subtract `2` from both sides: `P + R + Q = 9`.
    *   Also, since `2 + P + R + Q = 11`, we **carry over `1`** to the hundreds column (because `11` has a `1` in the tens place, and we carry the other `1` to the hundreds).

3.  **Analyze the Hundreds Column (leftmost):**
    *   We add the digits in the hundreds place: `5 + 3 + 2`, PLUS the `1` we carried over from the tens column.
    *   `1 (carry) + 5 + 3 + 2 = 11`.
    *   The result in the answer's hundreds column is `1` (from `1114`). This matches the `1` in `11`.
    *   This also means we carry over `1` to the thousands column, which explains the `1` in the thousands place of the final answer `1114`. This all checks out!

4.  **Maximize Q:**
    *   From our tens column analysis, we found `P + R + Q = 9`.
    *   We know `P`, `R`, and `Q` are single digits (0-9).
    *   To make `Q` as large as possible, we need `P` and `R` to be as small as possible.
    *   The smallest digit `P` and `R` can be is `0`.
    *   If `P = 0` and `R = 0`, then `0 + 0 + Q = 9`, which means `Q = 9`.

**Solution:**
- **Step 1: Add the digits in the Ones Column.**
  - `9 + 7 + 8 = 24`.
  - Write down `4` in the unit's place of the answer and **carry over `2`** to the tens column.

- **Step 2: Add the digits in the Tens Column (including the carry-over).**
  - The sum is `2 (carry) + P + R + Q`.
  - The unit's digit of this sum must be `1` (from `1114`). This implies the sum is `11`.
  - So, `2 + P + R + Q = 11`.
  - Rearrange: `P + R + Q = 11 - 2 = 9`.
  - Also, **carry over `1`** to the hundreds column (since the sum was 11).

- **Step 3: Add the digits in the Hundreds Column (including the carry-over).**
  - The sum is `1 (carry) + 5 + 3 + 2`.
  - `1 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 11`.
  - This perfectly matches the `11` (1 in hundreds place, 1 in thousands place) in the final answer `1114`. This confirms our calculations for the carry-overs.

- **Step 4: Find the maximum value of Q.**
  - We have the equation `P + R + Q = 9`.
  - To maximize `Q`, `P` and `R` must be minimized.
  - The minimum value for a digit is `0`.
  - So, if `P = 0` and `R = 0`, then `0 + 0 + Q = 9`, which means `Q = 9`.

✅ **Answer:** The maximum value of Q is **9**.

### **🧮 Example 4: Simplify**

**(i)** 5793405 × 9999  
**(ii)** 839478 × 625  

**Explanation Breakdown:**

These examples show clever multiplication tricks that simplify calculations, especially with numbers like 9999 or 625.

**(i) 5793405 × 9999**

1.  **Rewrite 9999:** Multiplying by numbers close to powers of 10 (like 9, 99, 999, 9999) can be simplified using the distributive property.
    *   `9999` is very close to `10000`. In fact, `9999 = 10000 - 1`.

2.  **Apply the Distributive Property:**
    *   `A × (B - C) = (A × B) - (A × C)`
    *   So, `5793405 × (10000 - 1)` becomes:
        *   `(5793405 × 10000) - (5793405 × 1)`

3.  **Perform the Multiplications:**
    *   `5793405 × 10000 = 57934050000` (just add four zeros)
    *   `5793405 × 1 = 5793405`

4.  **Perform the Final Subtraction:**
    *   `57934050000 - 5793405`
    *   Subtract vertically:
        ```
          57934050000
        -      5793405
        -----------------
        ```
        *   Starting from the right:
            *   `0 - 5` (borrow, `10 - 5 = 5`). (Previous 0 becomes 9).
            *   `9 - 0 = 9`. (Previous 0 becomes 9).
            *   `9 - 4 = 5`. (Previous 5 becomes 4).
            *   `4 - 3 = 1`.
            *   `0 - 9` (borrow, `10 - 9 = 1`). (Previous 3 becomes 2).
            *   `2 - 7` (borrow, `12 - 7 = 5`). (Previous 4 becomes 3).
            *   `3 - 5` (borrow, `13 - 5 = 8`). (Previous 9 becomes 8).
            *   `8` (no change).
            *   `7` (no change).
            *   `5` (no change).
        *   The result is `57928256595`.

**(ii) 839478 × 625**

1.  **Recognize 625 as a Power of 5:**
    *   `5¹ = 5`
    *   `5² = 25`
    *   `5³ = 125`
    *   `5⁴ = 625`
    *   So, `625 = 5⁴`.

2.  **Relate 5⁴ to Powers of 10:** It's often easier to multiply by powers of 10. We know `10 = 2 × 5`.
    *   If we have `5⁴`, we can turn it into `10⁴` by multiplying by `2⁴`.
    *   `5⁴ = (10 / 2)⁴ = 10⁴ / 2⁴ = 10000 / 16`.
    *   This means multiplying by 625 is the same as multiplying by 10000 and then dividing by 16. This is a very common trick for multiples of 25, 125, 625, etc.

3.  **Apply the Trick:**
    *   `839478 × 625 = 839478 × (10000 / 16)`
    *   `= (839478 × 10000) / 16`
    *   `= 8394780000 / 16`

4.  **Perform the Division:**
    *   `8394780000 ÷ 16`
    *   This is a long division. Let's do it step-by-step:
        *   `83 ÷ 16 = 5` (remainder `3`)
        *   `39 ÷ 16 = 2` (remainder `7`)
        *   `74 ÷ 16 = 4` (remainder `10`)
        *   `107 ÷ 16 = 6` (remainder `11`)
        *   `118 ÷ 16 = 7` (remainder `6`)
        *   `60 ÷ 16 = 3` (remainder `12`)
        *   `120 ÷ 16 = 7` (remainder `8`)
        *   `80 ÷ 16 = 5` (remainder `0`)
        *   Remaining zeros: `00`
    *   Result: `524673750`.

**✅ Solution:**

- **(i)** `5793405 × 9999`
  - Rewrite `9999` as `(10000 - 1)`.
  - `5793405 × (10000 – 1)`
  - Use distributive property: `(5793405 × 10000) - (5793405 × 1)`
  - `57934050000 - 5793405`
  - `= 57928256595`

- **(ii)** `839478 × 625`
  - Rewrite `625` as `10000 / 16` (since `625 = 5⁴` and `10000 = 10⁴ = (2×5)⁴ = 2⁴×5⁴ = 16×625`).
  - `839478 × (10000 / 16)`
  - `(839478 × 10000) / 16`
  - `8394780000 / 16`
  - `= 524673750`

✅ **Answer:** (i) **57928256595**; (ii) **524673750**
`

*   `(a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²`
*   `(a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b²`

**(i) 1605 × 1605**

1.  **Rewrite as a Square:** `1605 × 1605` is simply `1605²`.

2.  **Break Down into (a + b) form:** `1605` is close to `1600`. We can write `1605` as `1600 + 5`.
    *   So, `1605² = (1600 + 5)²`.
    *   Here, `a = 1600` and `b = 5`.

3.  **Apply the Identity (a + b)²:**
    *   `(1600 + 5)² = 1600² + (2 × 1600 × 5) + 5²`

4.  **Calculate Each Term:**
    *   `1600² = 16² × 100² = 256 × 10000 = 2560000`
    *   `2 × 1600 × 5 = 2 × 5 × 1600 = 10 × 1600 = 16000`
    *   `5² = 25`

5.  **Add the Terms:**
    *   `2560000 + 16000 + 25`
    *   `2560000`
    *   `  16000`
    *   `     25`
    *   `--------`
    *   `2576025`

**(ii) 1398 × 1398**

1.  **Rewrite as a Square:** `1398 × 1398` is `1398²`.

2.  **Break Down into (a - b) form:** `1398` is close to `1400`. We can write `1398` as `1400 - 2`.
    *   So, `1398² = (1400 - 2)²`.
    *   Here, `a = 1400` and `b = 2`.

3.  **Apply the Identity (a - b)²:**
    *   `(1400 - 2)² = 1400² - (2 × 1400 × 2) + 2²`

4.  **Calculate Each Term:**
    *   `1400² = 14² × 100² = 196 × 10000 = 1960000`
    *   `2 × 1400 × 2 = 4 × 1400 = 5600`
    *   `2² = 4`

5.  **Perform Subtraction and Addition:**
    *   `1960000 - 5600 + 4`
    *   `1960000 - 5600 = 1954400`
    *   `1954400 + 4 = 1954404`

**✅ Solution:**

- **(i)** `1605 × 1605 = (1605)²`
  - Use the identity `(a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²` where `a = 1600` and `b = 5`.
  - `(1600 + 5)² = 1600² + (2 × 1600 × 5) + 5²`
  - `= 2560000 + 16000 + 25`
  - `= 2576025`

- **(ii)** `1398 × 1398 = (1398)²`
  - Use the identity `(a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b²` where `a = 1400` and `b = 2`.
  - `(1400 – 2)² = 1400² – (2 × 1400 × 2) + 2²`
  - `= 1960000 – 5600 + 4`
  - `= 1954404`

✅ **Answer:** (i) **2576025**; (ii) **1954404**

### **🧮 Example 9: Find the square root**

Find √(4a² + b² + c² + 4ab - 2bc - 4ac)

**Explanation Breakdown:**

This problem asks us to simplify a complex expression under a square root. This looks like a variation of the `(x + y + z)²` identity.

The identity is: `(x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2xy + 2yz + 2xz`

Let's try to match the given expression `4a² + b² + c² + 4ab – 2bc – 4ac` to this identity.

1.  **Identify the Square Terms:**
    *   `4a²` is `(2a)²`. So, our `x` could be `2a`.
    *   `b²` is `(b)²`. So, our `y` could be `b`.
    *   `c²` is `(c)²`. So, our `z` could be `c` (or `-c` because `(-c)²` is also `c²`).

2.  **Look at the Cross-Product Terms and Their Signs:** This is where we figure out the signs of `b` and `c`.
    *   `+ 4ab`: This term is `2 * (2a) * b`. This means if `x = 2a` and `y = b`, then `2xy` is positive, which matches! So `b` is positive.
    *   `– 2bc`: This term is `2 * b * c` but with a negative sign. Since `b` is positive, `c` must be negative to make `2bc` negative.
    *   `– 4ac`: This term is `2 * (2a) * c` but with a negative sign. If `c` is negative, then `2 * (2a) * (-c)` would be negative, which matches!

3.  **Formulate the Expression:**
    *   Based on our analysis, let's try `(2a + b - c)²`.
    *   Let `x = 2a`, `y = b`, `z = -c`.
    *   `(2a + b - c)² = (2a)² + (b)² + (-c)² + 2(2a)(b) + 2(b)(-c) + 2(2a)(-c)`
    *   `= 4a² + b² + c² + 4ab – 2bc – 4ac`
    *   This perfectly matches the expression inside the square root!

4.  **Find the Square Root:**
    *   Since the expression is equal to `(2a + b - c)²`, its square root is `2a + b - c`.
    *   *(A small technical note: The square root of a square is actually `|x|` (absolute value), so `√(x²) = |x|`. However, in most aptitude test contexts, when asked to "simplify" or "find the value," they expect the positive root and often assume the variables are such that the expression is positive. So `2a + b - c` is the expected answer.)*

**Solution:**
- **Step 1: Recognize the pattern as a trinomial square.**
  - The given expression `4a² + b² + c² + 4ab – 2bc – 4ac` looks like the expansion of `(x + y + z)²`.
  - The identity is: `(x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2xy + 2yz + 2xz`.

- **Step 2: Match the terms to identify x, y, and z (with their correct signs).**
  - `4a²` suggests `x = 2a`.
  - `b²` suggests `y = b`.
  - `c²` suggests `z = c` or `z = -c`.
  - Now, check the cross-product terms:
    - `+4ab` matches `+2(2a)(b)`. This confirms `x = 2a` and `y = b`.
    - `–2bc` matches `+2(b)(-c)`. Since `b` is positive, `c` must be negative for this term to be negative. So, `z = -c`.
    - `–4ac` matches `+2(2a)(-c)`. This also aligns with `x = 2a` and `z = -c`.

- **Step 3: Substitute these values into the identity.**
  - So, the expression is equal to `(2a + b - c)²`.

- **Step 4: Find the square root.**
  - `√(2a + b - c)² = 2a + b - c`

✅ **Answer:** The square root is **2a + b – c**.

### **🧮 Example 10: Word Problem**

A is counting numbers from 1 to 31 (only odd numbers).  
B is counting from 31 down to 1 (all numbers).  
Both count at the same speed.  

Which number will A and B pronounce together?

**Explanation Breakdown:**

This is a simple sequence comparison problem. We need to list out the numbers each person counts and see where their lists overlap at the same "counting step."

1.  **List A's Sequence:** A counts odd numbers from 1 to 31.
    *   A: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31

2.  **List B's Sequence:** B counts all numbers from 31 down to 1.
    *   B: 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

3.  **Compare Step by Step:** Since they count at the same speed, we can line up their counts.
    *   A (1st number): 1
    *   B (1st number): 31

    *   A (2nd number): 3
    *   B (2nd number): 30

    *   A (3rd number): 5
    *   B (3rd number): 29

    *   A (4th number): 7
    *   B (4th number): 28

    *   ...and so on...

    A will count `2n - 1` for her `n`-th term.
    B will count `32 - n` for his `n`-th term.

    We want to find `n` where A's `n`-th term is equal to B's `n`-th term.
    *   `2n - 1 = 32 - n`
    *   Add `n` to both sides: `2n + n - 1 = 32`
    *   `3n - 1 = 32`
    *   Add `1` to both sides: `3n = 33`
    *   Divide by `3`: `n = 11`

    So, they will say the same number at their **11th count**.

    What is the 11th number A says?
    *   A's 11th number is `2 × 11 - 1 = 22 - 1 = 21`.

    What is the 11th number B says?
    *   B's 11th number is `32 - 11 = 21`.

    They both say `21` at the same time.

**✅ Solution:**
- **Step 1: List A's counting sequence (odd numbers from 1 to 31).**
  - A: `1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31`

- **Step 2: List B's counting sequence (all numbers from 31 down to 1).**
  - B: `31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, ...`

- **Step 3: Compare the numbers they pronounce at each step (since they count at the same speed).**

| Step | A's Number | B's Number |
| :--- | :--------- | :--------- |
| 1    | 1          | 31         |
| 2    | 3          | 30         |
| 3    | 5          | 29         |
| 4    | 7          | 28         |
| 5    | 9          | 27         |
| 6    | 11         | 26         |
| 7    | 13         | 25         |
| 8    | 15         | 24         |
| 9    | 17         | 23         |
| 10   | 19         | 22         |
| **11** | **21**     | **21**     |

  - Both A and B pronounce **21** together at their 11th count.

✅ **Answer:** Both A and B will pronounce **21** together.
